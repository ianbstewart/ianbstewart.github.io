I'm a second-year Ph.D student in the [Interactive School of Computing](http://www.ic.gatech.edu/) (in the [Human-Centered Computing](http://www.hcc.cc.gatech.edu) program) at the Georgia Institute of the Technology. My research is advised by [Jacob Eisenstein](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~jeisenst/) and examines sociolinguistic variation online. I'm currently interested in comparing the importance of social and semantic "niche" in the adoption of new words in an online community. 

You can reach me at istewart6 at gatech dot edu. In my free time, you'll find me making music and baking cookies.
