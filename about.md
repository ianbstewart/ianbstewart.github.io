I'm a Ph.D student in the [Interactive School of Computing](http://www.ic.gatech.edu/) (in the [Human-Centered Computing](http://www.hcc.cc.gatech.edu) program) at the Georgia Institute of the Technology. 
My research is advised by [Jacob Eisenstein](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~jeisenst/) and explores social change in online communities through analysis of language style.

Language reflects and constructs society, and nowhere is this more obvious than the social spaces of the internet. 
The fast speed of communication in online communications leads to frequent changes in communication style, often driven by the [constant turnover of members](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8258465).
I am especially interested in the role of linguistic *structure* in the landscape of social change: e.g. how does a linguistic structural constraint, such as the syntactic "flexibility" of a word, impact its likelihood of adoption? 
My work uses a combination of natural language processing and statistical methods to investigate specific cases of social change.
My prior work has investigated the [adoption of nonstandard words](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1467), the expression of political identity through [language choice](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N18-2022), and recently, measuring collective attention by tracking changes in the context of named entities.

I am currently seeking a post-doctoral fellowship in computational social science beginning in fall 2020.
