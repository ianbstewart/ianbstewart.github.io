I'm a fourth-year Ph.D student in the [Interactive School of Computing](http://www.ic.gatech.edu/) (in the [Human-Centered Computing](http://www.hcc.cc.gatech.edu) program) at the Georgia Institute of the Technology. My research is advised by [Jacob Eisenstein](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~jeisenst/) and examines the social ramifications of online language variation, which includes applying NLP techniques to social science domains. My past work has looked at the social and linguistic influences that drive the adoption of nonstandard language online. I'm currently interested in geographic modeling with applications to tasks like toponym resolution.
