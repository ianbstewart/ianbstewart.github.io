I am a [MIDAS](http://midas.umich.edu/) Fellow at the University of Michigan, where I work with the [LIT Lab](https://lit.eecs.umich.edu/) to develop NLP systems that can adapt to different social situations and provide better feedback to writers.

My current research focuses on (1) social ramifications of writing interventions and (2) assessing social bias in text.
For (1), I am currently interested in *audience-oriented* systems that can preempt possible information gaps among the readers of a particular piece of writing, e.g. missing information in advice-seeking posts online. 
More broadly, I'm investigating the role of automated writing interventions in helping writers understand their readers, and themselves, better.
For (2), I am working on several projects related to understanding bias in NLP systems, such as negative stereotypes about people of different races.

**NOTE**: I am not accepting personal/unpaid research interns. I am very confused about why this has become normalized in computer science research, and I discourage other academics from allowing students to provide unpaid labor. It doesn't count as an "internship" if the student is not receiving a tangible reward such as money or academic credit, or if there is no institutional oversight for the students' activity. I encourage interested students to look for official research programs such as the NSF's [Research Experience for Undergraduates program](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/).
