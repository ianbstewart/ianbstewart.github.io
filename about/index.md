I am a [MIDAS](http://midas.umich.edu/) Fellow at the University of Michigan, where I work with the [LIT Lab](https://lit.eecs.umich.edu/) to develop NLP systems that can adapt to different social situations and provide better feedback to writers.

My current research focuses on (1) social ramifications of writing interventions and (2) assessing social bias in text.
For (1), I am currently interested in *audience-oriented* systems that can preempt possible information gaps among the readers of a particular piece of writing, e.g. missing information in advice-seeking posts online. 
More broadly, I'm investigating the role of automated writing interventions in helping writers understand their readers, and themselves, better.
For (2), I am working on several projects related to understanding bias in NLP systems, such as negative stereotypes about people of different races.
 
In 2020 I earned my PhD from the [Interactive School of Computing](http://www.ic.gatech.edu/) (in the [Human-Centered Computing](http://www.hcc.cc.gatech.edu) program) at the Georgia Institute of the Technology. 
During my PhD, my research explored how sociolinguistic variation reflects communication goals in online discussions, including: (1) how people choose their language to address a partly-known audience; (2) how people adopt new words online; and (3) how social attitudes can explain language choices among multilingual people.
