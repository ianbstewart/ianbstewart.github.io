I am a research scientist at the [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://www.pnnl.gov/data-science-computing), currently working on machine learning applications. I conduct research in the areas of computational social science and natural language processing, and I'm especially interested in AI systems that augment human intelligence. Previously I worked as a post-doctoral [MIDAS](http://midas.umich.edu/) Fellow at the University of Michigan, and before that I earned my PhD in Human-Centered Computing from the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://ic.gatech.edu/).
 
You can reach me at ibs at dartmouth dot edu. In my free time, you'll find me running long distances and baking cookies.

**NOTE**: I am not accepting personal/unpaid research interns. I am very confused about why this has become normalized in computer science research. Academic researchers should not allow students to provide uncompensated labor. It doesn't count as an "internship" if the student is not receiving a tangible reward such as money or academic credit, or if there is no institutional oversight for the students' activity. I encourage interested students to look for official research programs such as the NSF's [Research Experience for Undergraduates](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/).
