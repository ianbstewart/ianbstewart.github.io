I am a fourth-year PhD student at Georgia Tech who is interested in language variation and change in online environments, as well as models for natural language processing that can generalize to noisy situations. 
You can find more info <a href="./about/">here</a>, my CV <a href="./docs/istewart_cv.pdf">here</a>, and my blog <a href="./blog/">here</a>.
