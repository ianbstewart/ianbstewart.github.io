Hi there!
I am a fourth-year PhD student at Georgia Tech who is interested in language variation and change in online environments, as well as models for natural language processing that can handle language variation. 
You can find more info <a href="./about/">here</a>, my CV <a href="./docs/istewart_cv.pdf">here</a>, and my blog <a href="./blog/">here</a>.

## News
*10.08.2018*: I had a [long paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00345) about nonstandard word adoption accepted at EMNLP 2018 and will be attending in November. See you all in Brussels!
