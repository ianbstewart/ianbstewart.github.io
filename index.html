Hi there!
I am a PhD student at Georgia Tech who is interested in language variation and change in online environments, such as the adoption of new words and the change in word meaning over time.
You can find more info <a href="./about/">here</a>, my CV <a href="./docs/istewart_cv.pdf">here</a>, and my blog <a href="./blog/">here</a>.

<li><b>01.06.2019</b>: I will be helping to present a tutorial on <a href="https://github.com/jacobeisenstein/language-change-tutorial">language change</a> at <a href="https://2019.ic2s2.org/">IC2S2</a> in Amsterdam on July 16. Let me know if you're attending and want to discuss how to study historical change with text data!
<li><b>21.01.2019</b>: I had a short paper about immigrant assimilation accepted to the <a href="https://www2019.thewebconf.org">Web Conference</a> based on the work I did at the <a href="https://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/">Max Planck Demographic Institute</a> last summer! Looking forward to seeing the other interesting web+society research.
