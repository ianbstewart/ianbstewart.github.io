Hi there!
I am a recent PhD graduate from Georgia Tech who is interested in studying how language variation can tell us about the limits of online communication, using natural language processing and statistical methods.
You can find more info <a href="./about/">here</a>, my CV <a href="./docs/istewart_cv.pdf">here</a>, and my blog <a href="./blog/">here</a>.

<ul>
<li><b>10.12.2020</b>: I presented a tutorial at CORE Congress about exploratory text analysis for computational social science. Materials <a href="https://github.com/ianbstewart/CORE_tutorial_2020">here</a>. 
<li><b>04.12.2020</b>: Paper accepted at <a href="https://blogs.umass.edu/scil/scil-2021-call-for-papers/">SCiL 2021</a>! We investigated the integration of English loanwords into Spanish (e.g. the verb "tuitear" for "to tweet"). Preprint coming soon.
