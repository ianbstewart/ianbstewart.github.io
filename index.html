I am a recent PhD graduate from Georgia Tech who is interested in studying how language variation can tell us about the limits of online communication, using natural language processing and statistical methods.
You can find more info <a href="./about/">here</a>, my CV <a href="./docs/istewart_cv.pdf">here</a>, and my blog <a href="./blog/">here</a>.

<b>News</b><br>
<ul>
<li><b>01.09.2020</b>: I will be a post-doctoral fellow at University of Michigan, working with the LIT lab on socially-oriented NLP.
<li><b>10.08.2020</b>: I defended my dissertation virtually. I guess that makes me a PhD in IT. 
<li><b>16.03.2020</b>: We had a paper accepted to ICWSM 2020! The paper investigates the use of descriptive information shared during breaking news events on social media, and we find support for theories of audience design among online discussion participants.
